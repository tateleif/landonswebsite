        <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on earth. They live in the forests of Asia and the African savannah. </p>

        <p>Asian Elephants have much smaller ears. Groups are normally lead by the oldest female, or the matriarch. The females are called cows and the males are called bulls. Bulls normally live alone or with other males. They mostly only interact with family when trying to mate. African Elephants are listed as vulnerable and Asian Elephants are endangered. One of their biggest threats is being poached for their tusks.</p>
