    <h1>Four bright planets align in the morning sky</h1>
    <img src="https://earthsky.org/upl/2020/03/2020-Mar-16-Saturn-Mercury-Mars-Jupiter-Mars-night-sky.jpg">
<text>In March 2020, the planets Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars form a "planetary conjuction."</text>
<text>Pluto, a dwarf planet, is also part of this conjuction, not counting that it is a dwarf planet.</text>
<text>It's no use trying to find Pluto with your eyes, anyways, as even most telescopes have a hard time picking it up.</text>
<text>If you do have a clear sky and a strong telescope, though, you may be lucky enough to spot a faint speck. The planets are'nt the only thing that will catch your eyes this morning though. Right from Mars, shines a buetiful half moon! Now if you go skygazing like, every day, you'd think this is'nt souch an experience. But even if you see it every night, now is the chance! The moon is going beneath the horizon soon.</text>
<h2>What's so special?</h2>
<text>So you might be asking, what's so special about that? But it's actually kind of rare to see one of these! It's so cool when the planets are totally lined up! I mean, they're always lined up in a straight line, but It's not all the time you get to see these all at once. So get outside, and look up!</text>
